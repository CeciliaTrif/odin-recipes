            A classic Italian pasta dish featuring spaghetti cooked to perfection and tossed in a fragrant blend of thinly sliced garlic,
            extra-virgin olive oil, and a hint of red pepper flakes for a mild kick. Finished with fresh parsley and optional grated Parmesan cheese,
            this simple yet flavorful recipe is a delightful comfort food.
            Ingredients:
            <ul>
                <li>8 ounces spaghetti</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
                <li>Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
            Instructions:
            <ol>
                <li>Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain, reserving a cup of pasta water.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes, and saut√© until the garlic turns golden brown (be careful not to burn it).</li>
                <li>Add the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss well with the garlic-infused oil. If the pasta seems dry, add a little of the reserved pasta water to create a sauce.</li>

                <li>Serve immediately, with optional grated Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
